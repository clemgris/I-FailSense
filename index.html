        Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not only accurate task execution but
        also the ability to detect failures for robust deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances
        in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning and task-planning
        capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability to recognize their own failures. In particular, a
        critical yet underexplored challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot executes a
        task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given instruction. To address this, we propose a
        method for building datasets targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing
        language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an open-source VLM framework with
        grounded arbitration designed specifically for failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base
        VLM, followed by training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to different internal
        layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that
        I-FailSense outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting semantic
        misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic misalignment detection, I-FailSense
        generalizes to broader robotic failure categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and
        real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training.
